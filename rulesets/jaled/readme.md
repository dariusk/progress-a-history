# Jaled

Someday, the Ajve will come to pass.

Humans will forge them, monsters of flesh and metal,
built and bred to work and wonder.

They will make poor prisoners,
but triumphant conquerers
of a world left glassed
by genocide.

The Ajve who remain send off for another world.

Jaled.

Home.

## Mechanics

You are the thoughts and beliefs of a society of Ajve colonists. They organize around the values you prioritize, and use them to shape the world. Meanwhile, other ideologies do the same with other societies.

Each turn, if your society is still alive, you select a value. The idea, or some element of it, strikes a chord with your people, and inspires them to action. These actions develop global diplomatic relations, harm or fortify the world's capacity to support life, and collect the resources your people need to survive. See [Values](#values) for a list of values you can select from each turn, and the actions they inspire.

At the end of your turn, your society consumes resources to survive. Some values will cause your society to consume more resources; others, less. *At the end of your turn, if your society has fewer resources than it needs to consume, it dies off.* The people of your society emigrate to other societies, or form new ones, but the way of life that united them lives on only in history. See [Exodus](#exodus) for details on society death and rebirth.

Some values affect persistent assets of your society, such as its military or infrastructure. These attributes require maintenance to retain value, so they consume resources each turn. Likewise, how your people have adapted to life on the planet, and how suited the planet is to hosting life, lower the resources your society consumes. See [Attributes](#attributes) for a list of them and details on each. How much your society consumes each turn is determined by this formula:

    might + infrastructure + wealth - adaptations - biodiversity

The game ends after 25 turns. Although the game does not assign victory or defeat to any society, here are some ways to judge a history:

* Of all societies to have existed in the game, who had the most resources?
* Of all societies to have existed in the game, who had the most mature ideology?
* Of all societies to have existed in the game, who had the most attributes?
* Of the societies alive at the end of the game, who had the most resources?
* Of the societies alive at the end of the game, who had the most mature ideology?
* Of the societies alive at the end of the game, who had the most attributes?

## Values

* Empire: Your society feeds on conflict. When you choose Empire as a value, your people **conquer** their enemies, increasing your Might by 1, and extracting 1 resource from each society with less Might than yours. Any society exploited this way loses 1 resource, or 2 if your people dislike them. Every society, harmed or not, decreases their disposition towards you by 1. *You might style yourself police, or a militia, or even a government of sorts. You might call this exploitation *protection* or even *law*, but wherever you take it, blood boils and spills and turns to mud full of lives cut short.*
* Profit: Your society preserves and values the ritual of commerce. When you choose Profit as a value, your people **trade** with another, increasing your Wealth by 1. Your society gains resources equal to the difference in Wealth between your society and the society with the least wealth that also has a positive disposition towards you. That society gains 1 resource, 1 Wealth, and decreases their disposition towards you by 1. *You gave them baubles, and took the land beneath their feet.*
* Knowledge: Your society delights in learning more about the universe and how to manipulate it. When you choose Knowledge as a value, your people **discover** new scientific mysteries, and develop miraculous inventions to use them. This increases your society's Might, Wealth, and Infrastructure by 1, and provides 3 resources.
* Mastery: Your society has its own ideas of perfection, and works to reshape all they can to suit it. When you choose Mastery as a value, your people **develop** sophisticated monuments to their ideals, scarring them into the land. Increase your Infrastructure by 1, decrease global Biodiversity by 1, decrease global disposition towards you by 1, and then gain resources equal to double your Infrastructure.
* Consent: Your society's people provide for each other through mutual aid and voluntary cooperation. When you choose Consent as a value, your people **organize** with all people to secure what they need, increasing global disposition towards you by 1. Your society gains 1 resource for each society with a positive disposition towards it. All other societies gain 1 yield.
* Harmony: Your society strives to protect and enrich the native ecosystems that host it. When you choose Harmony as a value, your people **adapt** to the planet, developing symbiotic relationships with indigenous flora and fauna. This increases your society's Adapatations by 1, and global Biodiversity by 1.

## Attributes

* Resources: Mundane artifacts that facilitate your people's way of life, including everything from food and clothing to cybernetic implants and designer genes. Your society consumes resources each turn depending on its attributes, or collects resources as fruits of the land.
* Might: Your military and its capacity to project coercive force. It increases how much your society consumes in resources, and your ability to extort resources from others.
* Infrastructure: Leavings of your efforts to terraform the planet. Your people scar the land with superhighways and orbital networks, boreholes and space elevators. It increases how much your society consumes in resources, but improves your ability to extract resources from the planet.
* Wealth: Trade goods. Wondrous and magnificent baubles the likes of which merchants in ages past have only dreamed. Your assets require constant manipulation to retain economic value, and so increase how much your society consumes in resources. It improves your ability to strike profitable trade deals, by trading luxury goods for the means of production.
* Adaptations: Ways in which your society has developed symbiotic relationships with indigenous ecosystems, from sustainable agriculture to symbiotic relationships with individual native species. Reduces how much your society consumes in resources each turn.
* Biodiversity: The resiliency of the planet's ecosystems against cataclysms both native and alien. Terraforming efforts reduce it; efforts to adapt, improve it. Biodiversity is an attribute of the world itself, and so affects, and is affected by, every society.

## Exodus

When a way of life becomes impossible, what happens to people that lived that way? Perhaps a cataclysm claims many, perhaps millions of them, but perhaps there are survivors, and perhaps they go on. They will never forget the culture that made them.

Societies that die out may spawn up to two new societies, which merge the dead society's ideology with up to two surviving society's ideologies, to form a new society. Because of how this works, societies guided by human players cannot spawn new societies.

Societies formed during a Exodus are guided by AI composed of new instances of other AI in the game. Each turn, the spawned AI chooses the value that the majority of its constituent AI would have chosen that turn. If there is no majority, it chooses randomly from among those choices.

Spawned AI have names formed by merging root words from their constituent AI, as ideologies and their artifacts fuse into a novel way of life.

## Schema of Terms

Each player or AI acts as an ideology for a society. Each ideology unites and defines the society it guides, and manifests as a way of life for that society's people.

When a way of life becomes impossible, such as through societal collapse, that society dies, and its people begin an Exodus.
