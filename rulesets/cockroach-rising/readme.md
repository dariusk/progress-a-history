# Cockroach Rising

THE WORLD HAS ENDED. At long last, mankind's precarious control of its own power slips and civilization is wiped away in radioactive ash and fire. From the rubble no survivors creep -- at least, not human ones. Cockroaches, resistant to the radiation and resilient against the elements, rise from the wastes and survey a new world -- their world. With most of life on earth gone, they are free of predators, and all the spoils of the earth are free to them for the taking. As the era of humanity closes, the age of the roach dawns.
